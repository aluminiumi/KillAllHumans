Included here are the source Psycle files for the various music tracks
(downloadable separately) created for Endgame: Singularity by Max
McCracken.

To generate your own files from these:

* Download Psycle from:

     http://psycle.pastnotecut.org/

  Note that Psycle is Windows-only, but it runs fine in current-enough
  releases of WINE.

* Download the Drumatic VE VST from:

     http://www.e-phonic.com/plugins/drumatic_ve.php

  and install it into Psycle's directories.  The included INSTALLATION.TXT
  explains the process, but the .dll goes into VstPlugins and the subdirectory
  goes directly into Psycle's directory.

* Load Psycle up.

* Go to View->Add Machine and click the 'Rescan all plugins...' button.  This
  will make Psycle detect the Drumatic VE VST plugin.

* Load one of the .psy files via File->Open and choose File->Render as WAV.
